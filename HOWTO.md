# How-to Guide

The KSLib repository is a place you can obtain useful examples
created by past contributors, be they users of the kOS mod,
or in some cases the original developers of the kOS mod.

Read the examples and copy the files
you want to use into your Ships/Scripts directory of your
Kerbal Space Program installation and use them from there.

We do ask that people submitting a suite of libraries
designed to work together try to follow these
general patterns:

  1. Try to break things up into smaller files.  A person trying
     to load them onto their installation may be trying to save
     space and want to only install those things they need.
  2. Try to include an example of how to use the files when you
     submit them.  Put the examples in the example folder and
     the actual library files they call in the library folder.

## Project Folder Layout

* library/
  * The place where the actual .ks files people can copy into their
      own installations go.
* examples/
  * The place where examples of scripts that call a library function
      can go.
* doc/
  * A place for you to describe your library and how to use it, in
      ASCII text or GitHub markdown files (.md).
* games/
  * A place to find kOS games written in KerboScript.  More detailed information can be found in the README.md file within the games folder
* library_ksm/
  * The place where the .ksm files of your library go.
      This directory **must not** contain files people can compile
      locally from .ks files of your library. It is only for files made
      or modified by external programs to allow stuff that isn't possible
      in KerboScript but is possible in opcode. It is **highly recommended**
      to minimize the amount of code placed in here because:
    * Backwards compatibility for .ksm files is not guarantied
        (e.g. some significant parser changes might break all old .ksm files).
    * It is a lot more difficult to modify and improve .ksm files when compared to .ks scripts.

## Credit

If you want to have proper kudos and credit for a thing you invented,
you are welcome to insert a comment in the script announcing that you
wrote it.  Or you can just rely on people having to look up the file's
git history to figure it out.  The choice is yours.

If you modify a script in which someone else has put such a
self-attribution comment into it, please don't remove it,
although feel free to add your own, as long as it doesn't
get out of hand with too many authors of the same file, in
which case it may make more sense to just say it was edited
by a consortium.
