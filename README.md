# KSLib

KSLib is the user community-supported standard library for the KerboScript language.

The contents of this repository are scripts intended for use
with the [kOS (Kerbal Operating System) mod](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS)
for Kerbal Space Program.

The scripts are written in the KerboScript language, which is described
on the [main documentation page for kOS](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/).

The goal of this repository is twofold:

1. To allow the developers of the kOS mod a place to put standard
     library scripts that enhance the usability of the mod.
2. To allow users of the kOS mod a place to participate as a group,
     submitting their helpful additions to the library of scripts.

Please see the [How-to Guide](HOWTO.md) for how to use the files in this
repository.

Please see the [Library Summary](SUMMARY.md) about the available libraries and the
functions they provide.

## Why the MIT License

The main kOS mod has been released under version 3 of the [GNU General Public License (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), but KSLib has chosen the [MIT License](LICENSE) instead.  Why?

1. MOSTLY THIS ONE -> The GNU GPL is verbose.  Applying it significantly increases the size of each KerboScript source code file, unnecessarily occupying precious kOS disk capacity.
2. Casual KerboScript programmers who just want to do something small and simple may find the GNU GPL intimidating.
